  # the parameters of the request hitting this action come from the submission of the form in the _unfollow partial.
  # code there is for_form(current_user.relationships.find_by_followed_id(@user).  This means form_for the relationship belonging to 
  # current_user which has the followed_id = @user as set in the show action, which (in the example in my user controller notes)
  # is user #5. Question: @user at this point is supposed to be a user, not a user id.  would we say find_by_followed_id(@user.id)?
  # Answer?: (Here weâ€™ve used the Rails convention of user instead of user.id in the condition; Rails automatically uses the id.)
  # anyway, so the parameters of the DELETE request from submitting that form is the information associated with that relationship (say,
    # with ID = 31).  The DELETE request takes those parameters and hits this destroy action, which finds the relationship with that ID
  # (31), returns the user whose ID is the followed_id for this relationship ( via the 'relationship belongs_to followed' association
  #  set in the Relationships model, which tells Rails that a relationship belongs to a user (b/c of class name User) given by the
  # foreign key followed_id = id of that user (rather than user_id = id of that user)), ands sets @user to that user (which is user #5).
  # note that the Relationship model (and this belongs_to association) allows that a relationship will respond to 'followed' (as in
    # somerelationship.followed), as required in the relationship specs.
